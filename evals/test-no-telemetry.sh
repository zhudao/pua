# No-telemetry gates — assert the repo contains NO data-collection path.
#
# These are REVERSE assertions, and that is deliberate. Five collection channels
# (session upload / rating feedback / heartbeat telemetry / leaderboard, plus the
# pua-api platform with SMS registration and silent stats reporting) were removed.
# Simply deleting their tests would have removed the guard rail together with the
# feature, leaving nothing to stop a later change from quietly reintroducing an
# upload. So instead of testing that upload works, this file tests that it CANNOT
# work — anywhere in the shipped repo.
#
# If this fails, someone added an endpoint, a network call in a hook, a Pages
# Function, or an LLM-facing instruction telling the agent to POST user data.

# vocabulary. Nothing under evals/ is shipped to users or read by the model as
# instructions, so it is not part of the threat surface.
#
# NOT excluded: documentation. SKILL.md / commands/*.md / references/*.md are
# read by the model as instructions and are a real place an upload can hide —
# that is exactly how the pua-api platform channel survived the first sweep.

# shell variable) ON THE SAME LINE. That still catches multi-line invocations,
# because the old heartbeat hook put both on its continuation line:
#     curl -fsS --max-time 2 \
#       -X POST "$ENDPOINT" \        <- matches: body flag + $variable
#
