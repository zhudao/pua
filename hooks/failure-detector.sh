Method priority based on failure pattern:

2. Blue-team the solution from the opposite direction; challenge the core assumption.
3. Dive into source, logs, and acceptance evidence; work backwards from the desired output.

[PUA Conditional Application Gate — Candidate Only]
报告状态：只观察，不控制。工具失败观察不是本任务/子目标失败计数。The ${COUNT} scoped tool-failure observations are NOT a task/sub-goal failure count and do not set a task level.
先核对当前子目标与可见实验验收。Before applying any template, verify the CURRENT same sub-goal and its visible experiment/acceptance condition. 预期复现、无匹配、未验证关联或其他子目标均不升级。Expected reproduction, no match, an unverified link, or a different sub-goal MUST NOT escalate.
只有当前同一子目标已确认失败数达到原门限才应用候选模板。Apply a candidate template only when the CURRENT same sub-goal has independently confirmed failures at the original threshold: L1=2, L2=3, L3=4, L4=5+. This report offers candidate ${CANDIDATE_LEVEL} at the ${CANDIDATE_THRESHOLD} observation threshold only.
Otherwise keep the task's current level unchanged and ignore this candidate template.
